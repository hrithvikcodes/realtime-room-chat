# Realtime Room Chat API 🚀
A fully deployed **FastAPI backend** for realtime, room-based communication with **JWT authentication**.  
Features include **invite-only room joining**, **interactive messaging**, **ImageKit.io** integration for media management (profile pics & chat media), **Redis caching** for fast message delivery, and **Google Gemini 2.5** to generate intelligent chat summaries for new members.

## Key Features
*   **Real time Messaging** : Bi-directional communication using WebSockets.
*   **AI Context Summaries** : Powered by **Gemini 2.5** to catch up on missed messages easily.
*   **Message Caching** : Last 100 messages per room cached in **Redis** for fast retrieval and AI context.
*   **Media Management** : Profile pictures and chat media handled via **ImageKit**
*   **Secure Auth** : JWT Based Authentication with refresh tokens saved in the database, rotated on each use and invalidated on logout which prevents reuse attacks.
*   **Invite-Only Rooms**: Rooms are protected by a unique invite code. Only users with the code can join. Admins can regenerate the code at any time to invalidate old links.
*   **Room Management** : Admin led rooms with capabilities to **kick members**, add room profile picture, update room details like description and name.
*   **Storage Optimization**: Automatic cleanup of old media; when a user updates or deletes a media file, the previous file is deleted from **ImageKit** storage to save space.
*   **Structured JSON Logging** : Production grade logging across all layers (auth,rooms,messages,Websockets,HTTP middleware) with structured JSON output for easy querying.
*   **Structured Backend** : Modular architecture with dedicated routers, models, and CRUD layers for scalability.
*   **Rate limiting** : unauthenticated endpoints (login, signup) are rate limited by IP. authenticated endpoints are rate limited by user ID so VPN bypasses won't work.

## Tech Stack

***Load Testing***
Tested with Locust : The test includes 32 users logging in simultaneously, each sends a message, handles 32 concurrent web socket connections across 4 rooms with 8 users each.
##Results: 
*  **Min response time** : 390ms
*  **Median response time**: 580ms
*  **Max response time** : 821ms
*  **Failure rate**: 0%
>Running on Railway's free tier (512 GB RAM, 1v CPU, shared). These numbers reflect that constraint. On a dedicated server with more resources, both throughput and latency would improve significantly.
>The ~200ms baseline is geographic , test machine is in India, Railway servers are in US Oregon. On a closer server  these numbers would roughly halve.

**Scaling note : **
The current WebSocket manager keeps connections in memory on a single server. This works well for the current scale but wouldn't support horizontal scaling. The fix would be replacing the in memory manager with Redis Pub/Sub so multiple server instances can share connections, that's on the roadmap.
